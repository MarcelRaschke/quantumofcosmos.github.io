What does Mechanical engineering, Hyderabad, Data science, Violin and this site's avatar have in common.?

Well, not much, except they all can be used to describe me.

Some more things about me...

- I am an amateur developer and Data science enthusiast from Hyderabad.
- I'm extremely committed to any project I take-up.
- I like to keep things clean. Both Data and my surroundings.
- I can say Hi in German and bit more than Hi in Telugu, Hindi, English, and Tamil.
- I convert Documentation, Stack-overflow and Music into working applications in Hyderabad for living.
- I rock a great moustache  :man:


What else do you need? :smiley: :relaxed:

P.S. **What does Quantum-of-cosmos even mean?**

According to Wiki:
**Quantum** is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction.

**Cosmos** is the universe. Cosmos is used at times when the universe is regarded as a complex and orderly system or entity; the opposite of chaos.

So quantum of cosmos makes me a small but significant entity in this universe.!
