So, for a long time I wanted to offer the knowledge I have as a series of blog posts, which will also aid me in coming to a better terms with my concepts. But the problem was that I had no clue where to start.That is until now.

I recently came across an Infographic by Swami Chandrasekaran. The Infographic, although is from 2013 (meaning a lifetime ago at the pace research is moving now) has laid out a road to accomplish all the necessary skills that I am interested and a few more.

The above map is self-evidently crafted with great care as the topics (or the stops) start from beginner level slowly progressing towards advanced. Thereby making it easy to follow as we progress along a track.

I therefore offer you this as my invitation to travel with me on my journey along this track.
